# VisAnalysisTool
This is the technical part of Murad Rajabov's thesis containing code written in Python and CSV file (which was used during development phase and which was described in 4.3 subchapter of the thesis.\
Abstract of the thesis:
This bachelor thesis aims to develop a visual analysis tool for representing traffic accident data along with additional information related to the accident location. The objective is to improve road safety by identifying patterns and trends through effective data visualization. The thesis begins with a literature review to explore the current state of the art in visual analysis tools for traffic accident data. Data on traffic accidents, daylight, and weather conditions will be gathered and pre-processed from relevant sources. The tool will be designed and developed using appropriate software tools, followed by a comparison with existing tools. The justification for the topicality of the thesis lies in the global concern over traffic accidents and the need for improved road safety. While there are existing visual analysis tools, they often lack the ability to integrate additional relevant data. The proposed tool aims to address these limitations by incorporating data on accident location, daylight, and weather conditions.
